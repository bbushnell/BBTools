  - Clipping limits enforcement with testClippingLimits() using extreme cases like "GGGGGATCGTTTT" vs "ATCG" verifying excess clipping conversion to substitution penalties when maxClips exceeded
  - Edge case validation with testEdgeCases() including 1bp references, 1bp queries, and extreme size mismatches ensuring boundary condition robustness
  - Non-overlapping scenario testing with testNonOverlapping() handling cases where query and reference don't overlap (far negative rStart or far positive positions)
  - Mixed clipping and substitution testing with testClippingWithSubstitutions() verifying combined penalty calculations for sequences with both clipping and alignment mismatches
  - Exact match verification with testExactMatch() providing basic sanity checks for perfect alignment scenarios
- **Usage**: Quality assurance and regression testing for clipping functionality ensuring IndelFreeAligner handles edge cases correctly

#### CrossCutAligner (CrossCutAligner.java)
**Purpose**: Aligns two sequences to return ANI using 3 scoring arrays and avoids traceback with diagonal processing optimization
- **Core Function**: Revolutionary diagonal-processing alignment algorithm iterating over cross-cut diagonals from bottom-left to top-right, eliminating inter-loop data dependencies and enabling superior parallelization
- **Key Features**:
  - Diagonal processing algorithm with main loop iterating k=2 to qLen+rLen processing matrix diagonals rather than rows/columns eliminating data dependencies for parallel execution
  - Three-array diagonal storage (diag_km2, diag_km1, diag_k) providing rolling diagonal buffers with array rotation avoiding memory allocation overhead
  - 64-bit packed encoding using POSITION_BITS=21, DEL_BITS=21, SCORE_SHIFT=42 supporting sequences up to 2Mbp with position tracking, deletion counting, and score storage
  - SIMD vectorization support through shared.SIMDAlign.processCrossCutDiagonalSIMD() for diagonal processing with scalar fallback ensuring compatibility across architectures
  - Boundary condition handling with specialized handleTop() and handleLeft() functions processing matrix edge cells separately from inner diagonal computation
  - Mathematical constraint-based postprocessing using system (M+S+I=qLen, M+S+D=refAlnLength, Score=M-S-I-D) for exact operation count recovery without traceback
  - Windowed alignment capability through alignStatic() overload accepting refStart/refEnd parameters enabling targeted reference region analysis
  - Optional sequence swapping optimization ensuring query ≤ reference length when position vector not required reducing memory footprint
- **Usage**: High-performance sequence alignment research with novel diagonal processing approach achieving superior parallelization and cache efficiency for computational biology applications
