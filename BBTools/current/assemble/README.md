  - `quality.clone()` protects quality score checkpoints when available  
  - `counts.copy()` preserves k-mer frequency data independently

- **Null Safety Handling** (lines 33-34, 55-56, 60-63): Comprehensive null checking for optional data:
  - Quality scores may be null in some sequencing formats
  - K-mer counts are algorithm-specific and may not exist
  - Restoration methods handle all null combinations safely

**Restoration Algorithm**:
- **Phase 1**: Restore core read properties (ID and flags) unconditionally
- **Phase 2**: Determine restoration strategy based on sequence length comparison
- **Phase 3a** (efficient path): Use System.arraycopy for same-length arrays
- **Phase 3b** (reference path): Assign saved references for length mismatches

**Usage**: Essential for assembly algorithms that attempt risky operations on reads:
- Error correction algorithms can revert unsuccessful fixes
- Extension algorithms can restore original state after failed elongation
- Quality improvement routines can rollback unsuccessful modifications
- Iterative assembly methods can reset to known good states

**Implementation Notes**: The length-based restoration strategy optimizes for common assembly scenarios where sequence length remains constant during processing, while gracefully handling expansion/contraction cases through reference assignment. Public access to `counts0` enables algorithm-specific k-mer frequency analysis during rollback decisions.

### Shaver1.java - Specialized Dead-End and Bubble Removal Algorithm

**Purpose**: Implements specialized algorithms for removal of dead ends (hairs) and bubble structures from De Bruijn graphs using bidirectional path exploration and termination code analysis

**Core Function**: Performs graph cleaning through exhaustive path exploration from k-mer seeds, categorizing termination reasons to identify removable structures. Uses atomic work distribution across multiple hash tables to enable parallel processing while maintaining thread safety through ownership claims (lines 58-113, 125-251).

**Key Features**:

- **Dual Structure Removal** (lines 32, 91-109): Configurable removal of two problematic graph structures:
  - **Dead-End Removal**: Eliminates linear paths terminating in single-branch dead ends (removeHair flag, lines 91-99)
  - **Bubble Removal**: Collapses alternative paths between shared branch points (removeBubbles flag, lines 101-109)

- **Bidirectional Path Exploration**: Core algorithm `exploreAndMark()` performs systematic graph traversal:
  - Forward exploration from initial k-mer seed using `explore()` method
  - Reverse-complement exploration for complete path characterization
  - Termination code analysis to classify path endpoints (lines 71-73, 76-84, 86-88)

- **Termination Classification System**: Seven distinct termination codes for path analysis:
  - `DEAD_END`: No valid extensions available (lines 146-149, 189-192, 288-290, 335-337)
  - `TOO_LONG`: Path exceeds maximum exploration distance (lines 248-250, 389-391)
  - `TOO_DEEP`: K-mer coverage exceeds threshold indicating repetitive regions (lines 239-242, 380-382)
  - `F_BRANCH`: Forward branching detected via multiple valid extensions (lines 234-237, 338-340)
  - `B_BRANCH`: Backward branching identified through count comparison analysis (lines 212-228, 360-376)
  - `LOOP`: Circular path detection via first k-mer comparison (lines 178-181, 311-314)

- **Multithreaded Processing Architecture**:
  - **ExploreThread**: Parallel dead-end detection using atomic table assignment (lines 418-435, 438-457)

  - Bit-level k-mer construction with mask operations (lines 132-134, 170-174)
  - Branch detection via second-highest count analysis (lines 155-156, 199-200, 212-228)

- **Coverage-Based Filtering** (lines 142, 158, 239-242): Uses configurable thresholds:
  - `minCount`: Minimum k-mer coverage for valid extensions (constructor line 32)
  - `maxCount`: Maximum coverage threshold to avoid repetitive regions (constructor line 32)
  - `minSeed`: Minimum coverage for exploration seeds (lines 495, 508, 528, 542)

- **Loop Detection Mechanism** (lines 138-139, 178-181, 268-269, 311-314): Maintains first k-mer reference for circular path identification

- **Thread Safety Implementation**:
  - **Atomic Work Distribution**: Uses `nextTable.getAndAdd(1)` for lock-free table assignment (lines 419, 439, 762)
  - **Ownership Claims**: Thread-safe k-mer marking via `claim()` operations (lines 77, 82, 94, 104, 111)
  - **Status Management**: Hierarchical status system (STATUS_UNEXPLORED, STATUS_EXPLORED, STATUS_REMOVE) prevents race conditions

**Performance Optimization Features**:

- **High-Count Neighbor Search**: Optimized algorithm for high-coverage k-mers:
  - Processes neighbors of high-count k-mers rather than the k-mers themselves
  - Uses bit masking for efficient neighbor generation
  - Implements safe fallback for core mask conflicts (lines 632, 708-737)

- **Memory-Efficient Processing**: Thread-local bit manipulation variables:
  - Pre-calculated shift values for k-mer size operations
  - Bit masks for efficient DNA encoding/decoding

**Usage**: Integrated into assembly pipelines for graph cleaning after initial k-mer table construction:
- Input: KmerTableSet with coverage statistics and configurable processing parameters
- Processing: Parallel exploration threads identify removable structures, followed by removal threads
- Output: Cleaned k-mer tables with dead ends and bubbles eliminated

**Implementation Notes**: The algorithm implements conservative defaults with low thresholds and both removal types enabled. The dual `explore()` and `explore2()` methods (lines 125-251, 256-392) suggest algorithm refinement, with `explore2()` providing streamlined termination logic. Thread-local data structures optimize performance by avoiding synchronization overhead during intensive graph traversal operations.
